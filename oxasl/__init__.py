OXASL - Python package for ASL-MRI analysis
===========================================

Copyright (c) 2018 University of Oxford

The modules in this package are mostly Python replacements for existing shell script
and C++ code from the oxford_asl FSL module.

For many tools, FSL is required. The ``fslpy`` package is used to wrap required tools
such as BET and FAST.

Design
------

AslImage
~~~~~~~~
The ``oxasl.image.AslImage`` class represents a captured ASL data file. It
contains information about the acquisition (number/values of TIs/PLDs, repeats,
ordering of label/control image etc). It also has methods which act directly
on the data, for example performing tag-control subtraction, or generation of
a perfusion-weighted image.::

    img = AslImage("mpld.nii.gz", plds=[0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0], iaf="tc", order='lrt')
    diffdata = img.diff()
    pwi = img.perf_weighted()

Workspaces
~~~~~~~~~~
The ``workspace`` module contains the ``Workspace`` class which
can be used to build a higher-level interface for complex workflows. A
workspace is simply an object whose attributes are images, data, etc being
used as part of the workflow. Unlike a normal object, requesting an attribute
that does not exist returns None rather than raising an exception.::

    wsp = Workspace()
    print(wsp.asldata) # prints None

A workspace can optionally be associated with a physical directory. If it is,
then setting attributes causes files to be saved in this directory for supported
data types, such as images or 2D matrices.::

    wsp = Workspace(savedir="myoutput")
    wsp.asldata = AslImage("mpld.nii.gz", ntis=1) # Saves myoutput/asldata.nii.gz

A workspace is also associated with
a log stream (sys.stdout by default) and a prepared logging dictionary ``fsllog``
for passing to FSL Python wrapper commands::

    wsp = Workspace()
    wsp.log.write("Hello World\n")
    wsp.rois.mask = fslmaths(img).bin().run(log=wsp.fsllog)

Module functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Other modules typically contains one or more functions which operate on a
workspace, in some cases with additional parameters (but not always).

Module functions operate under the general rule that data stored directly
as a workspace attribute is unprocessed, user-supplied data. Derived data
is then stored in a sub-workspace. Module functions will usually create
a sub-workspace to store their own output in, for example the ``struc`` module
places it's output (brain extractions, segmentations) in the wsp.structural
sub-workspace.

For example the ``calib`` module contains the ``calibrate`` function which
calibrates a perfusion image to physical units using either voxelwise or reference
region methods. It reads parameters required for this from the workspace, including
the calibration method to use.

Most of these functions write their output back into the workspace under a standard
name, however in some cases the function might be called on different input images
and might therefore return an image directly, which can be added to the workspace
by the caller under whatever name they prefer

Command line tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Most modules include a ``main()`` function which implements a command line
tool to wrap the module functionality. For example the ``preproc`` module
implements the ``oxasl_preproc`` command line tool which can be used to
do simple preprocessing of ASL data, such as the following to perform
label-control subtraction::

    oxasl_preproc -i asldata.nii.gz --nplds=5 --diff -o asldata_diff.nii.gz

Current ASL processing modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - :mod:`basil` - ASL Bayesian Model fitting using the Fabber code
 - :mod:`calib` - Calibration of perfusion data using voxelwise or reference region methods
 - :mod:`corrections` - Calculate and apply corrections (motion, distortion)
 - :mod:`mask` - Calculation of a suitable mask for brain data
 - :mod:`pipeline` - Unified processing pipeline for ASL brain data
 - :mod:`preproc` - Basic ASL preprocessing (label-control subtraction, etc)
 - :mod:`reg` - Registration between ASL, structural and standard spaces
 - :mod:`region_analysis` - Summary stats within ROIs

Other modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 - :mod:`image` - Definition of the main AslImage class
 - :mod:`reporting` - Generation of HTML reports from processing operations
 - :mod:`workspace` - Definition of the Workspace class
